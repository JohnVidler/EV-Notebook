# EV Notebook

Created to collect the ephemeral knowledge of DIY EV builders, mostly so I can find it all again more easily...

- [Vehicle Information](/info) - Individual files for each vehicle
- [Parts Information](/parts) - Folders by type, files per part
- [Datasheets](/datasheets) - Mostly referenced elsewhere, but if you really want to browse the lot here you go...

Some folders also contain a general README which will include subtopic-spanning material. Hopefully this is of use to someone later :)
